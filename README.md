This project provides solution to Programming Exercises given in C++ Primer, 5th Edition by Stanley Lippman.

The include/ folder contains the Header files necessary to build the solutions.
The src/ folder contains the C++ solutions.

Steps to Build
--------------
1.  Run autogen.sh
    > ./autogen.sh

2.  Run the generated configure script
    > ./configure

3.  Run Make
    > make

All the object files (*.o) and executables (*.exe) would be generated in the src/ folder.
Change the working directory to src/ and you could run the individual solutions.
